## Overview

This is the setup required to contribute to our Cookbook. These are not in order, because there are different ways you can start working and contributing. You will need a GitHub account, which is described in the tutorials (link upcoming as that is tidied).

This chapter describes initial setup, with workflows described in more detail in the next chapter.

## Access JupyterHub

Our [Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub](https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/hub/) is available for Mentors and their colleagues to develop, test, and teach. Using the JupyterHub is described in the tutorials (link upcoming as that is tidied).

To request access, you'll need a GitHub username and to fill out this [JupyterHub request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcKar-yNnofiAVKlks79AgmQeM1beLCQM5TW_0__x_JU4B3g/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Clone Cookbook from GitHub

Now clone our Cookbook and make it your current directory.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook
cd earthdata-cloud-cookbook
```

## Meet Quarto

Explore [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and use it hands-on in our separate [Quarto Website Tutorial](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/). Quarto is already installed in our JupyterHub. 

Background: Quarto is a new open-source scientific and technical publishing system. It makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered using Jupyter and Knitr engines.

## Build Cookbook!

You should now be able to serve our Cookbook from the `earthdata-cloud-cookbook` directory.

``` bash
quarto serve
```

This will open the Cookbook as a new tab in your browser. Now you're all set to contribute to the Cookbook! Read about how in the next chapter.
