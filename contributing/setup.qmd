## Overview

This is the setup required to contribute to our Cookbook. These are not in order, because there are different ways you can start working and contributing. You will need a GitHub account, which is described in the tutorials (link upcoming as that is tidied).

This chapter describes initial setup, with workflows described in more detail in the next chapter.

## Create a GitHub Account

-   GitHub: <https://github.com>
-   Follow optional [advice on choosing your username](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)

## Access JupyterHub

Our [Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub](https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/hub/) is available for Mentors and their colleagues to develop, test, and teach. Using the JupyterHub is described in the tutorials (link upcoming as that is tidied).

To request access, you'll need a GitHub username and to fill out this [JupyterHub request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcKar-yNnofiAVKlks79AgmQeM1beLCQM5TW_0__x_JU4B3g/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Clone Cookbook from GitHub

Now clone our Cookbook and make it your current directory.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook
cd earthdata-cloud-cookbook
```

## Configure GitHub, with PAT

To configure your GitHub account in the 2i2c JupyterHub, follow these [2021 Cloud Hackathon instructions](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/tutorials/00_Setup.html#step-5.-tracking-changes-optional). These instructions are for Jupyter and will also set up credentials for RStudio users; however for RStudio-specific instructions (not specific to our 2i2c Hub) please also see [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html).

## Sync from 2i2c (local) to GitHub (remote)

Ensure you can sync and practice the GitHub workflow. Here, "local" means the 2i2c Hub, but could also mean your local desktop software for Jupyter, VS Code, RStudio, etc.

Syncing to GitHub.com means 4 steps:

1.  Pull
2.  Stage
3.  Commit
4.  Push

Review the [2021 Cloud Hackathon instructions](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/tutorials/00_Setup.html#step-5.-tracking-changes-optional) for step-by-step screenshots for syncing. RStudio users can follow [R for Excel Users instructions](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/github.html#sync-from-rstudio-local-to-github-remote).

## Build Cookbook!

We use [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to build ("serve") our Cookbook and publish it via GitHub. In the Terminal, your current directory should already be the cookbook (`cd earthdata-cloud-cookbook`). Type the following, which will open the Cookbook as a new tab in your browser:

``` bash
quarto serve
```

Background: Quarto is a new open-source scientific and technical publishing system. It makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered using Jupyter and Knitr engines. Explore [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and use it hands-on in our separate [Quarto Website Tutorial](https://openscapes.github.io/quarto-website-tutorial/). Quarto is already installed in our JupyterHub.

Now you're all set to contribute to the Cookbook! Read about how in the next chapter.
