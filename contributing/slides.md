## Quarto slides

`quarto preview`

This will return a url - open that url in another browser window and it will auto-refresh as you save your document. Note that previews will auto-update - but if they don't, refresh the browser and the updates should flow again after that.

From J.J.: 

> The websocket connection used to keep the preview live does seem to work, although I've seen times where a manual refresh of the browser is required. This is likely due to some very obscure websocket handling issue somewhere in the networking stack (so not really worth or even possible to debug). I would just tell people that previews will auto-update and if they don't just refresh the browser and the updates should flow again after that.
