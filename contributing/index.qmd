## How we work

The [Openscapes Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/approach/) describes how we work, including creating space and place, having a growth mindset, psychological safety, and continual learning, practice, and iteration. It also has our [code of conduct](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/approach/code-of-conduct.html) and an overview of some of the workflows and tooling we use.

We believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science. These are critical to uncovering enduring science-based solutions faster, as well as for the well-being and resilience of research communities. We work towards kinder science.

Our NASA Openscapes team is collaborating to create this Cookbook, with an eye towards how others could collaborate with us in the future.

Our style of working is greatly influenced by:

-   [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/mozilla-open-leaders/)
-   [The Turing Way Community Handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/community-handbook.html)
-   [The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development)
-   [The Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/)

## Our Cookbook is made with Quarto

We're making the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook with [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/), a new open-source scientific and technical publishing system. We have been early external users and testers as Quarto has been developed; learn more about this in our [Hello Quarto Community Call](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2022/06/22/hello-quarto/) and in our RStudio::conf keynote (upcoming).

See more about how to use Quarto to contribute to the Cookbook in the following [setup](setup.qmd) and [workflow](workflows.qmd) chapters.
