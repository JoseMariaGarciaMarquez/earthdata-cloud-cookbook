## How we work

The NASA Openscapes Mentor Community is collaborating to create this Cookbook, with an eye towards how others could collaborate with us in the future.

The [Openscapes Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/approach/) describes how we work, including creating space and place, having a growth mindset, psychological safety, and continual learning, practice, and iteration. It also has our [code of conduct](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/approach/code-of-conduct.html) and an overview of some of the workflows and tooling we use.

We believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science. These are critical to uncovering enduring science-based solutions faster, as well as for the well-being and resilience of research communities. We work towards kinder science.

Our style of working is greatly influenced by:

-   [The Turing Way Community Handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/community-handbook.html)
-   [The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development)
-   [The Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/)
-   [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
-   [eScience Hackweeks](https://guidebook.hackweek.io/intro.html)

The Earthdata Cloud Cookbook is made with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) with our [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/) JupyterHub. Learn more in the [Setup](setup.qmd) and [Workflow](workflow.qmd) sections.
