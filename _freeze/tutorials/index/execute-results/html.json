The tutorials exemplify the advantages of working with NASA Earthdata in the cloud and aim to provide a starting point for exploring what your workflows could look like in the cloud. \n\n---\n\n### **Earthdata Cloud Clinic** - [Tutorial](../tutorials/Earthdata-cloud-clinic.ipynb)\n*Two different direct cloud access & subsetting options available in the Earthdata Cloud*\n\n### **Sea Surface Temperature and Wind Speeds during a Hurricane** - [Tutorial](Hurricanes_Wind_and_Sea_Surface_Temperature.ipynb)\n*Obtaining NASA Earthdata from different disciplines and data centers*\n\n### **Sea Level Rise** - [Tutorial](Sea_Level_Rise.ipynb)\n*Using the earthaccess Python package for quick sea level rise analysis in the cloud*\n\n### **Distribution of Carbon Stocks in a Protected Area** - [Tutorial](Above_Ground_Biomass_Density.ipynb)\n*Using earthaccess Python package and OPeNDAP to access predictions of the aboveground biomass density*\n\n### **Observing Seasonality in Agricultural Areas** - [Tutorial](Observing_Seasonal_Ag_Changes.ipynb)\n*Working with HLS Landsat and Sentinel-2 data products in the cloud*\n\n### **ICESat-2 and Landsat cloud access and data integration** - [Tutorial](../external/IS2_cloud_Landsat_integration.ipynb)\n*Accessing multiple large datasets in the cloud*\n\n### **Pairing Cloud and non-Cloud Data** - [Tutorial](04_On-Prem_Cloud.ipynb)\n*Accessing and harmonizing data located within and outside of the NASA Earthdata Cloud*\n\n### **`earthaccess` Python Library Demo** - [Tutorial](earthaccess-demo.ipynb)\n\n### **Using OPeNDAP in the Cloud** - [Tutorial](Earthdata_Cloud__Data_Access_OPeNDAP_Example.ipynb)\n\n### **Pygeoweaver Workflow Demo** - [Tutorial](fair-workflow-geoweaver-demo.ipynb)\n\n---\n\nWe also have links to past [workshops](../workshops/index.qmd). Tutorials in these past workshops are developed to teach open science and Cloud workflows for specific audiences. They are a snapshot in time as workflows with NASA Earthdata Cloud emerge and evolve.\n\n",
