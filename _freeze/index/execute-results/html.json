Its purpose is to learning-oriented to support scientific researchers using NASA Earthdata from Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate their workflows to the cloud. \n\n## The new cloud paradigm\n\nNASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) are in the process of moving their data holdings to the cloud. In the new paradigm, data storage (orange in the illustration) will migrate to the cloud (green) and DAAC-provided tools and services built on top of the data are co-located in the Earthdata Cloud.\n\n![Illustration by Catalina Oaida, PO.DAAC](cloud-paradigm-earthdata-oaida.jpg)\n\nAs this data migration occurs, DAACs will have more information about how users can access data. For example, the [Cloud Data page at PO.DAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/cloud-datasets/about) offers access to resources to help guide data users in discovering, accessing, and utilizing cloud data. During this transition, some data will continue to be available from the traditional on premise archive, while some data will also be available from and within the Earthdata Cloud.\n\n\n**To learn more about NASA's EarthData Cloud Migration:**\n\n- [How we work](https://vimeo.com/434343794) - Katie Baynes, Keynote at FedGeoDay2020 (video). Nice overview of EOSDIS work and emphasis on open science\n- [Cloud Data Egress: How EOSDIS Supports User Needs](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/cloud-data-egress) - Emily Cassidy (blog). Describes supporting users’ needs during cloud migration by providing analysis-ready data\n\n\n\n## About\n\nThis Earthdata Cloud Cookbook is being developed as a cross-DAAC collaboration by the NASA-Openscapes team.
