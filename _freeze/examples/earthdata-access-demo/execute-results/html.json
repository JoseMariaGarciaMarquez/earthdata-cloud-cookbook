We can use DAAC specific portals or tools.\nWe could even use [data.gov](https://data.gov)!  Web portals are great but they are not designed for programmatic access and reproducible workflows. This is extremely important in the age of the cloud and reproducible open science. \n\nThe good news is that NASA also exposes APIs that allows us to search, transform and access data in a programmatic way. Many of these libraries contain amazing features and some similarities. In this context, **earthdata** aims to be a simple library that can deal with the important parts of the metadata so we can access or download data without having to worry if a given dataset is on-prem or in the cloud.\n\n\n\nLibrary | Language Agnostic | On-Prem Access | Cloud Access | Programmatic | Subsetting | GIS Operations | Authentication | Full Archive Coverage|\n-------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | -----\n**earthdata** | Python| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | No | No | ✅ | ✅\n**HarmonyPy** | Python* | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | No\n**OpenDAP** | ✅ | ✅ | No | ✅ | ✅ | No | No |  ✅ \n**cmr-stac** | Python | ✅ | ✅ |✅ | No | No | No |  ✅ \n**Earthdata Portal** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅| No | No | No | ✅ |  ✅ \n**GDAL** | ✅* | ✅ | ✅ |✅ | No | ✅* | ✅* |  ✅ \n**rsat** | R | ✅ | No |✅ | No | ✅* | ✅* |  No\n**getSpatialData** | R | ✅ | No |✅ | No | ✅* | ✅* |  No\n\n",
