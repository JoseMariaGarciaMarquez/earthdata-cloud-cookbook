title: Python example with Quarto

This is a .qmd file. I write prose here, using keyboard shortcuts or clicking above **to make text bold** and other formatting.

As I develop I'll interactively run the following, but can set up caching so that it doesn't execute the code

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

text boxes like this one are in **markdown**
