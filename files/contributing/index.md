This is how our Openscapes Cohort collaborates to create this book, with an eye towards how others could collaborate with us in the future. 

Our Cookbook is created with **Quarto**: [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/). Quarto makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered using Jupyter and Knitr engines.
