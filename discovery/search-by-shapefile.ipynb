        "This notebook walks through the discovery, download, and plotting of remote sensing ocean SST level 2 (L2) data over a geographic region of interest defined by the user (through the use of common GIS files such as .shp) during the 2020 hurricane season. \n",

        "The evolution of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Gulf of Mexico before, during, and after Tropical Cyclones can be explored using NASA remote sensing data, such as the MODIS Aqua SST dataset. An ocean response can often be seen in the wake of hurricane tracks, with cold wakes, or areas of cooler water, along or to the right of hurricane tracks in association with wind-induced water column mixing that brings cooler waters at depth to the surface. These cold signatures are generally patchy and spatially confined. \n",
        "\n",
        "As NASA Earthdata transitions to the Earthdata Cloud, it will be common for some data to exist in a traditional on-premise storage system, accessed by direct download to a local environment, while other data will have migrated to the cloud system. This need to access and customize data from the Earthdata Cloud, and work with it locally is described in this notebook. This access workflow of cloud-based data and downloding to local environment for further analysis or use is presented in the Introduction (Part I) of the workshop, and described again here:\n",

        "*Note: In this example we are using a shape file to search on ocean remote sensing data, although one can do this type of search on any Earthdata (DAAC) data. For example, of particular interest could be using shape files to search on terrestrial hydrology data (e.g watersheds), globally (depending on data availability of course).* \n",
