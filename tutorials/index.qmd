The following tutorials are meant to present example workflows with NASA Earthdata in the cloud from a variety of use cases. The tutorials exemplify the advantages of working with NASA Earthdata in the cloud and aim to provide a starting point for exploring what your workflows could look like in the cloud. 

*We are in the process of updating the specific tutorials on this page and revising them for cohesion. At the moment, they have been gathered from different GitHub repositories that the NASA Openscapes Mentors have worked with or contributed to.*

### **Earthdata Cloud Clinic** - [Tutorial](../examples/Earthdata-cloud-clinic.ipynb)
*Two different direct cloud access & subsetting options available in the Earthdata Cloud*

### **Sea Surface Temperature and Wind Speeds during a Hurricane** - [Tutorial](../external/How_to_Perform_Cross-DAAC_S3_Bucket_Access_Using_Python.ipynb)
*Obtaining NASA Earthdata from different disciplines and data centers*

### **ICESat-2 and Landsat cloud access and data integration** - [Tutorial](../external/IS2_cloud_Landsat_integration.ipynb)
*Accessing multiple large datasets in the cloud*

### **Sea Level Rise** - [Tutorial](../external/Sea_level_rise_notebook.ipynb)

### **`earthaccess` Python Library Demo** - [Tutorial](earthaccess-demo.ipynb)

We also have links to past [workshops](../workshops/index.qmd). Tutorials in these past workshops are developed to teach open science and Cloud workflows for specific audiences. They are a snapshot in time as workflows with NASA Earthdata Cloud emerge and evolve.
