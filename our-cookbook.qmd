## How to use the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook

Our Cookbook is a place to learn, share, and experiment with NASA Earthdata on the Cloud. We know this has a lot of moving parts, and we are iterating as we go, and welcome feedback and contributions.

The Cookbook has **How To** building blocks and **Tutorials** that connect these building blocks through an example research question and specific data. How To guides and Tutorials are stable approaches we've developed and used to teach; they have been iterated and improved through feedback from researchers during [events we've led](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/tutorials.html). We also share work **In Development**: primarily lessons and other works-in-progress that we're developing.

Working with NASA Earthdata in the Cloud means using a combination of software, tools, many of which require coding and are unfamiliar when we first get started. This is true for us all; we're all coming with different skills and backgrounds and you're not alone as we all learn these new technologies and workflows. We have found it helpful to have a [growth mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X0mgOOSpLU&t=11s&ab_channel=TED) - these approaches are new and we don't know how to do them ***yet***. Please, don't struggle alone - know that we're all in this together as part of the open source community learning and co-creating together as we migrate our research to the Cloud.

You're able to reuse any code in this book, adapting it for your own purposes. All chapters in the book are a combination of narrative, links, code, and outputs --- and underlying each chapter is a file type that you can access on [NASA-Openscapes GitHub](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook) (linked on the left navbar and right margin of each page): Markdown (`.md`), Jupyter (`.ipynb`), RMarkdown (`.rmd`) or Quarto (`.qmd`) files.

We will also be adding citations throughout so that you can easily credit the NASA Openscapes Mentors who created them.

## Learning to code

Here are resources we recommend to help strengthen your coding skills for programmatic access to NASA data on the cloud. As a starting point, [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) offer many [workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) both remotely and in person around the world. They also offer workshops in R and Python. All curriculum is online, so it's possible to use this as a self-taught course too.
