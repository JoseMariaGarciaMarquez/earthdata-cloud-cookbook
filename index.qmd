## Welcome

**Welcome to the NASA Openscapes EarthData Cloud Cookbook!**

This Cookbook is learning-oriented to support scientific researchers using NASA Earthdata from Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate their workflows to the cloud. It has resources to learn how to work with NASA Earthdata on the cloud, as well as well as documentation for how to contribute to these resources. It is under active, open development.

## The Cloud Paradigm

NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) are in the process of moving their data holdings to the cloud. In the new paradigm, data storage (orange in the illustration) will migrate to the cloud (green) and DAAC-provided tools and services built on top of the data are co-located in the Earthdata Cloud.

As this data migration occurs, DAACs will have more information about how users can access data. For example, the [Cloud Data page at PO.DAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/cloud-datasets/about) offers access to resources to help guide data users in discovering, accessing, and utilizing cloud data. During this transition, some data will continue to be available from the traditional on premise archive, while some data will also be available from and within the Earthdata Cloud.

**To learn more about NASA's EarthData Cloud Migration:**

-   [NASA EarthData Cloud Evolution](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/cloud-evolution) - Starting point for understanding the background for moving to the Cloud.
-   [How we work](https://vimeo.com/434343794) - Katie Baynes, Keynote at FedGeoDay2020 (video). Nice overview of EOSDIS work and emphasis on open science
-   [Cloud Data Egress: How EOSDIS Supports User Needs](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/cloud-data-egress) - Emily Cassidy (blog). Describes supporting users' needs during cloud migration by providing analysis-ready data

## About

This Earthdata Cloud Cookbook is being developed as a cross-DAAC collaboration by the NASA-Openscapes team. Learn more at [nasa-openscapes.github.io](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io).
