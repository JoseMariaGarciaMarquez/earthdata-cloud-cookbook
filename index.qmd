**Welcome to the NASA Openscapes EarthData Cloud Cookbook!**

This Cookbook is under active development but is an open resource as we iterate. Its purpose is to learning-oriented to support scientific researchers using NASA Earthdata from Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate their workflows to the cloud. 

## The new cloud paradigm

NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) are in the process of moving their data holdings to the cloud. In the new paradigm, data storage (orange in the illustration) will migrate to the cloud (green) and DAAC-provided tools and services built on top of the data are co-located in the Earthdata Cloud.

As this data migration occurs, DAACs will have more information about how users can access data. For example, the [Cloud Data page at PO.DAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/cloud-datasets/about) offers access to resources to help guide data users in discovering, accessing, and utilizing cloud data. During this transition, some data will continue to be available from the traditional on premise archive, while some data will also be available from and within the Earthdata Cloud.
