## Welcome

**Welcome to the NASA Openscapes Earthdata Cloud Cookbook!**

This Cookbook is learning-oriented to support scientific researchers who use NASA Earthdata as NASA migrates data and workflows to the cloud. It has resources to learn how to work with NASA Earthdata in the cloud, as well as documentation for how to contribute to these resources. It is under active, open development.

**Tip: use the _earthaccess_ Python library to access NASA Earthdata**. [earthaccess](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python library that streamlines access to NASA Earthdata locally or in the cloud. To learn more, see this [tech spotlight](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/news/2024-03-04-earthaccess-tech-spotlight/), the [NASA Earthdata blog post](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/blog/earthaccess), and these [how-to's](how-tos/find-data/find-python.html) and [tutorials](tutorials/). 

Looking for R and MATLAB help? See the [earthdatalogin R package](https://boettiger-lab.github.io/earthdatalogin/), and tutorials for [R](how-tos/find-data/find-r.html) and [MATLAB](tutorials/matlab.qmd) in this cookbook.

## The Cloud Paradigm

NASA Earthdata is available from Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) [Distributed Active Archive Centers](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/daacs) (DAACs) that are in the process of moving data holdings to a cloud platform. In the new paradigm, data storage (orange in the illustration) will migrate to the cloud (green) and DAAC-provided tools and services built on top of the data are co-located in the Earthdata Cloud.

As this data migration occurs, DAACs will have more information about how users can access data. For example, the [Cloud Data page at PO.DAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/cloud-datasets/about) offers access to resources to help guide data users in discovering, accessing, and utilizing cloud data. During this transition, some data will continue to be available from the traditional on premise archive, while some data will also be available from and within the Earthdata Cloud.
