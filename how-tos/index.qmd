title: How-To Guides
---

**How-To Guides** are recipes.  They provide a step-by-step guide to
solve a particular problem.  For the most part, they are short.  They
are written with the assumption that you know what you want to do and
have at least some understanding of programming.  You can think of "*How-tos*"
as building blocks that can be put together to acheive a larger task
or workflow.

If you are just learning either programming or working in the cloud,
we recommend looking at our [**Tutorials**](../tutorials/index.qmd).  
If you are looking for inspiration or examples of cloud workflows
applied to particular problems look at the collection of [**Example Workflows**](../examples/index.qmd).
