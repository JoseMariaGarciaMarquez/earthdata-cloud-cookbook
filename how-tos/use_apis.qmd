## Using APIs

*Coming soon: Intro with short explicit description. APIs - What are they? Borrow from get-started/api-primer.md* 

## How do I know?

How do I know what API services are available for a dataset?

Some but not all datasets have API services that can reproject, resample or reformat files on the server file. This How-To shows how to find which services are available.

### Services using EarthData Search

## AppEEARS

The [Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples (AρρEEARS)](https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/) offers users a simple and efficient way to perform data access and transformation processes. By enabling users to subset data spatially, temporally, and by layer, the volume of data downloaded for analysis is greatly reduced. AppEEARS requests can be submitted in website and via API. In a same way, outputs generated can also be accessed from AppEEARS website and through API. View [AppEEARS documentation](https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/help) and [API documentation](https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/api/) for more information. Additionally, you can work with the data in the cloud using provided S3 links. Visit [AppEEARS Data Resources Repository](https://github.com/nasa/AppEEARS-Data-Resources) for more tutorials on how to work with AppEEARS programaticaly.
