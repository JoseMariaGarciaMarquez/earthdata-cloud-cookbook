# How-To Guides Parking Lot

This is a document to capture and organize How-To Guides that do not,
yet, have a place in the Cookbook.  I've pulled examples from the
[Hackday Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzT-iSFlWZLS38eoPmFseljyMKDQIAc-24qH6QpnRCc/edit#)

Not all of these how-tos may be required.  Some may be redundant.
Some may be too complicated and could be broken into several How-Tos.
Feel free to add comments, links, notes, etc under each suggested
How-To.  Also suggest changes to the wording.  Following the Divio
documentation guide, I've tried to name how-tos with descriptive names
that start "How do I... ?". 

_We need a page to explain terminology; collections, granules, ..._
