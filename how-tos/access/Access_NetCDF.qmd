## Python

In Python we can use the [`earthdata`](https://earthdata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library (to be renamed `earthaccess` very soon!)

To install the package we'll run this code from the command line. Note: you can run shell code directly from a Jupyter Notebook cell by adding a `!`: `!conda install`.

```{bash}
# Install earthdata
conda install -c conda-forge earthdata
```


```{python}
## Import earthdata
from earthdata import DataGranules
```


## R

R code coming soon!

```{r}
# Coming soon!
```

## Matlab

Matlab code coming soon!

```{bash}
#| echo: true
# Coming soon!
```

## Command Line

With `wget` and `curl`:

```{bash}
# Coming soon!
```
