title: How do I access data stored in Earthdata Cloud?
---

When you have found the datasets and data granules you want to use,
you have two options.  You can download that data or, if you are
working in the cloud, you can access the data directly.  This second
way of working is called "_Direct Access_".

* How do I directly access data on Amazon S3?
* How do I access cloud-hosted data that has an End-User License Agreement (EULA)?

Coming soon: Introduction to the cloud data access landscape including
data access options (HTTPS, S3) and data format considerations. -
_Maybe move this to a "Discussion or Background" section.
