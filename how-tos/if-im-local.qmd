## Downloading data

When you have found the data you want to use, you have two options.  You can download the data to work locally, or access the data directly to work in the cloud. This second way of working is called "_Direct Cloud Access_" or simply, "_Direct Access_". 

This page covers two situations of downloading data from Earthdata Cloud to your local machine:

* Downloading data using the `earthaccess` library
* Downloading data from an OPeNDAP server
