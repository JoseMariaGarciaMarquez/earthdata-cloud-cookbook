## Overview

#### TL;DR: [**earthdata**](https://github.com/nsidc/earthdata) is a Python package to search, preview and access NASA datasets (on-prem or in the cloud) with a few lines of code.

```python

from earthdata import Auth, DataGranules, Store

# first we authenticate with NASA EDL
auth = Auth().login(strategy="netrc")

# Then we build a Query with spatiotemporal parameters
GranuleQuery = DataGranules().concept_id("C1575731655-LPDAAC_ECS").bounding_box(-134.7,58.9,-133.9,59.2)

# We get the metadata records from CMR
granules = GranuleQuery.get()

# Now it{s time to download (or open) our data granules list with get()
files = Store(auth).get(granules, local_path='./data')

# Now to the important science!
```


### Why?

There are many ways to access NASA datasets, we can use the [Earthdata search portal](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/). We can use DAAC specific portals or tools.
We could even use [data.gov](https://data.gov)!  Web portals are great but they are not designed for programmatic access and reproducible workflows. This is extremely important in the age of the cloud and reproducible open science. 

The good news is that NASA also exposes APIs that allows us to search, transform and access data in a programmatic way. Many of these libraries contain amazing features and some similarities. In this context, **earthdata** aims to be a simple library that can deal with the important parts of the metadata so we can access or download data without having to worry if a given dataset is on-prem or in the cloud.
