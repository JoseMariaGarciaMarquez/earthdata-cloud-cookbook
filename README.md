# Hello! 

This Earthdata Cloud Cookbook is being developed by the [NASA Openscapes team](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/).

In 2023 we are iterating and improving on our original cookbook structure, incorporating current technical approaches and what we've learned teaching NASA colleagues and Earth science researchers. We will increasingly track our tasks and progress using [issues](https://github.com/nasa-openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook) in this repository. We are having ongoing virtual Hackdays ([ongoing notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzT-iSFlWZLS38eoPmFseljyMKDQIAc-24qH6QpnRCc/edit) and [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10WC19Rrkq7YM1P3cc6qjI8rm8yi7yiYo/edit#gid=877539921)) to focus progress together.

Hackdays:
