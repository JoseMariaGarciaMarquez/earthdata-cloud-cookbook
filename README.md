# Hello!

This Earthdata Cloud Cookbook is being developed by the [NASA Openscapes team](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/).

## How to contribute to our book

Information for our team [to contribute to the Cookbook](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/contributing/). This includes setup and workflow instructions.

## Hackdays

In 2023 we are iterating and improving on our original cookbook structure, incorporating current technical approaches and what we've learned teaching NASA colleagues and Earth science researchers. We will increasingly track our tasks and progress using [issues](https://github.com/nasa-openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook) in this repository. We are having ongoing virtual Hackdays ([ongoing notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzT-iSFlWZLS38eoPmFseljyMKDQIAc-24qH6QpnRCc/edit) and [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10WC19Rrkq7YM1P3cc6qjI8rm8yi7yiYo/edit#gid=877539921)) to focus progress together.

Hackdays:

-   February 2, 2023
-   March 2, 2023

-   added CC-BY [license](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/blob/main/LICENSE.md) and added [license text to page footer](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/commit/6841a703346eeb3e93d798a6f7e244df792cfac5) (Erin+Stef)

-   Planned How-Tos restructure through organization & level of granularity on left and right nav ([draft PR](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/pull/182)) (Andy, Catalina, Mahsa, Alexis, Julie)

-   Update and add Cloud OPeNDAP tutorials ([issue](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/issues/177)) (Chris, Michele)

-   Reviewing earthaccess tutorial in cookbook to parse and point to the docs; also [how to sync a forked repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork#syncing-a-fork-branch-from-the-command-line) via cmd line (Jess)

### **Progress following Hackday 1**

-   [\_CookbookTutorialsInventory_Feb_2023.xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10WC19Rrkq7YM1P3cc6qjI8rm8yi7yiYo/edit#gid=877539921) that Catalina made to identify Tutorials in the Cookbook and track decisions and progress for updating; and [Imported Cloud Hackathon Tutorials](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/pull/176) so this content is available to modernize in the cookbook

-   [Reorg How-Tos structure as \"How Do I...\"](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/how-tos/) - the work that Andy led to restructure the How-Tos structure to be more goal-oriented

-   [Cookbook GitHub Issues](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) - began organizing ideas in Issues
