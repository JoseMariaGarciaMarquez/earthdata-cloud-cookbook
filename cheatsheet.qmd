Here are some cheatsheets and slides helping visualize what working with NASA Earthdata Cloud data, and how to get started.

## What does working with NASA Earthdata Cloud data look like?

[Slides: NSIDC DAAC User Working Group: NASA Earthdata Cloud Intro and Demonstration](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wtlgt-wUx8HgeWjoxvvz4BwknLlKDmGP2F-pSuI5utQ/edit?usp=sharing) by Andrew Barrett, Amy Steiker, Walt Meier, Jennie Roebuck, Mikala Beig, Luis Lopez, May 20, 2022.

## Tools & Services Roadmap

This is a practical guide for learning about and selecting helpful tools or services for a given use case, focusing on how to find and access cloud-archived data from local compute environment (e.g. laptop) or from a cloud computing workspace, with accompanying example tutorials. Once you "choose your own adventure", click on the respective blue notebook icon to get to the tutorial. Note: these pathways are not exhaustive, there are many ways to accomplish these common steps, but these are some of our recommendations.

### General Data Workflow

*Describes the above graphics*

Search

Login via Earthdata Login (EDL) for access

Authenticate with AWS credentials for access

Preprocess data using transformation services e.g. subset in space, time, by variable; reformat to COF \|\| e.g. service: OPeNDAP, Harmony

Visualize data accessed

Continue science or applications analysis

## Glossary (abridged)

Here is an abridged glossary of the relevant terms above, in the context of this workflow diagram/Cookbook. See [NASA Earthdata Glossary](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/user-resources/glossary) for a full list.
