Here are some cheatsheets and slides helping visualize what working with NASA Earthdata Cloud data, and how to get started.

All slides and cheatsheets are available for re-use and remix! 

Slides are credited for each deck; Cheatsheets development have been led by Catalina Oaida Taglialatela and Cassie Nickles (PO.DAAC) in Spring 2022.

## What does working with NASA Earthdata Cloud data look like?

## What is the NASA Earthdata Cloud?

NASA Earthdata Cloud is the NASA archive of Earth observations and is hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud with DAAC tools and services built for use “next to the data.” The NASA DAACs (data centers) are currently transitioning to this cloud-based environment. The cloud offers a scalable and effective way to address storage, network, and data movement concerns while offering a tremendous amount of flexibility to the user. Particularly if working with large data volumes, data access and processing would be more efficient if workflows are taking place in the cloud, avoiding having to download large data volumes. Data download will continue to be freely available to users, from the Earthdata Cloud archive.

## Cloud Access Pathways

Three pathway examples, to interact and access data (and services) from and within the NASA Earthdata Cloud, are illustrated in the diagram. Green arrows and icons indicate working locally, after downloading data to your local machine, servers, or compute/storage space. Orange arrows and icons highlight a workflow within the cloud, setting up your own AWS EC2 cloud instance, or virtual machine, in the cloud next to the data. Blue arrows and icons also indicate a within the cloud workflow, through shareable cloud environments such as Binder or JupyterHub set up in an AWS cloud region.

## Tools & Services Roadmap

This is a practical guide for learning about and selecting helpful tools or services for a given use case, focusing on how to find and access cloud-archived data from local compute environment (e.g. laptop) or from a cloud computing workspace, with accompanying example tutorials. Once you "choose your own adventure", click on the respective blue notebook icon to get to the tutorial. Note: these pathways are not exhaustive, there are many ways to accomplish these common steps, but these are some of our recommendations.

### General Data Workflow

*Describes the above graphics*

Search

Login via Earthdata Login (EDL) for access

Authenticate with AWS credentials for access

Preprocess data using transformation services e.g. subset in space, time, by variable; reformat to COF \|\| e.g. service: OPeNDAP, Harmony

Visualize data accessed

Continue science or applications analysis
