!!!!! INTRODUCTION

## About the Cloud

### Cloud Optimized Data Formats

Some nice info here from Pangeo about Cloud Optimized Data Formats.

* [**Cloud-Performant NetCDF4/HDF5 Reading with the Zarr Library**](https://medium.com/pangeo/cloud-performant-reading-of-netcdf4-hdf5-data-using-the-zarr-library-1a95c5c92314)

### S3 Buckets, etc

* [**NASA AWS Cloud Primer**](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/user-resources/webinars-and-tutorials/cloud-primer)

## Coding Languages & Environments

Here are resources we recommend to help strengthen your coding skills for programmatic access to NASA data on the cloud. As a starting point, [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) offer many [workshops](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) both remotely and in person around the world. They also offer workshops in R and Python. All curriculum is online, so it's possible to use this as a self-taught course too.

### Python

* [Duke STA-663 - Colin Rundel](https://sta663-sp22.github.io/). Lecture slides & recordings, code & notebooks. Features Jupyter, git, numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn...
* [Intro to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with Python - Carpentries](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/geospatial-python/). Follow-along tutorials & code. Features NEON data, intro to rasters & geostats rioxarray, geopandas...
* [Intro to Earth and Environmental Data Science- Ryan Abernathy](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html). Intro to Python, JupyterLab, Unix, Git, some packages & workflows
* [Scalable and Computationally Reproducible Approaches to Arctic Research - NCEAS](https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2023-03-arctic/). Advanced topics in computationally reproducible research in python, including environments, docker containers, and parallel processing using tools like parsl and dask, responsible research and data management practices including data sovereignty and the CARE principles, and ethical concerns with data-intensive modeling and analysis.

#### Scientific Python Ecosystem, Earth science and Cloud Computing together

* [Project Pythia Foundations Book](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html)
* [Jupyter meets Earth](https://jupytearth.org/)
* [The Environmental Data Science Book](https://the-environmental-ds-book.netlify.app/welcome.html)
* [CU EarthLab's Earth Data Science](https://www.earthdatascience.org/)
* [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/)

#### Python environments with Conda useful for scientific Python (recommended by Luis Lopez)

* [Reproducible and upgradable Conda environments with conda-lock](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/conda-dependency-management/)
* [Managing virtual environments with pyenv](https://towardsdatascience.com/managing-virtual-environment-with-pyenv-ae6f3fb835f8)
