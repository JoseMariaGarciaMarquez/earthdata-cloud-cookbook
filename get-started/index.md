So, you wanna get started working with NASA Earthdata in the cloud? You've come to the right place. This page provides resources that can be considered precursors to the how to's, tutorials, and other guidance you will find across our cookbook.

## Earthdata Login

To access NASA Earthdata, whether through your web browser or the cloud, you must first register for an Earthdata Login (EDL) user profile. Once registered, you can use your login credentials to get data through multiple access points. Read about EDL and get registered by following the directions on the [Welcome to Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/documentation/for_users/welcome) page.

## Coding Essentials

To access the cloud programmatically we must have a basic understanding of how to code using common, cloud-relevant languages. Most scientists who work with Earth data use either Python or R already, so we focus on those languages. If you are new to coding, we recommend you participate in a [Carpentries Workshop](https://carpentries.org/workshops/) or use open-source resources to teach yourself.  

### Bash & Git

Cloud services often are connected to and operated through Bash, a command-line interface and language you’ll see called the terminal, the command line, or the shell. Git is a commonly used version control system that is accessible through Bash. Version control is important for data collaboration because it allows changes by multiple people to be tracked and merged into one source.  

* [**The Unix Shell**](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) These lessons will introduce you the shell, a fundamental tool for performing a wide range of computing tasks.  

* [**Version Control with Git**](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) This tutorial will introduce you to Git, a popular open source distributed version control system.  

### Python

Python is a programming language widely used in web applications, software development, data science, and machine learning. Python is popular because it is free, efficient, easy to learn, and can run on most platforms.  

* [**The Python Tutorial**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system.  

* [**Pythia Foundations**](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html) This book is intended to educate the reader on the essentials for using the Scientific Python Ecosystem (SPE): a collection of open source Python packages that support analysis, manipulation, and visualization of scientific data.

### R

R is an open-source, platform-independent programming language used for data analysis, statistics, and visualization. You can also use R to connect with cloud services.

* [**R for Excel Users**](https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/) This course is a friendly intro to becoming a modern R user, full of tidyverse, RMarkdown, GitHub, collaboration, and reproducibility.

* [**R for Data Science**](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) This book will teach you how to do data science with R, including how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, and visualize.
