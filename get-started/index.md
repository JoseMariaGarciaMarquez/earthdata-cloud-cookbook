This Cookbook has mostly stand-alone recipes: both building blocks and end-to-end workflow examples that put together some of those building blocks. User can 'choose their own adventure' and build their own workflows based on their need.

Working with NASA Earthdata in the Cloud requires programmatic access, which for open source languages often means coding in Python or R.

## Learning to code

For programmatic access to NASA data on the cloud, we recommend familiarity with basic programming in R or Python. Here are resources we recommend to help get you started.
