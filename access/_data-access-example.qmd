## Like a notebook experience but a text file in a visual editor

```{python}
1+1
2+2
```

Just working on narrative, can set up caching like Jupyterbook so that it doesn't execute the code

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

this is an aid to your composition as you go, but then you still render
