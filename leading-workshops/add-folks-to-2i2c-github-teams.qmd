1.  Ask participants: Please add your GitHub Username to this form: <https://forms.gle/XRPsKiqaZC4bkYoi8> 

2.  Set the [Openscapes JupyterHub Sheet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xeSEv_NWIay00M8wWp5NSCFxGtIZvLd148VuRMwPYSs/edit#response=ACYDBNibER-tNcT6dFTmMU54wY9-yl2B-W3kYhQH2PMv_y7uUDbjg1u22FeO0qLZAJIC9BY) and [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ipMjDIk7B7oiwanThwXjA_m2JvKA0wbGE01u-Azu75A/edit#gid=1514300535) to notify when there are responses.

GitHub will ask you for 2factor authentication the first one you add, not after that

This is what this looks like in their inbox:

6.  Go back to the form and grab the email. Send an email to the person: 

NASA Openscapes Access to 2i2c Hub: 

\

**Email for General requests:** 

\

Hi \[FIRST NAME\] - 

I have added you to the NASA Openscapes 2i2c Jupyter Hub. Here is the link to the hub: <https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/> 

There is a getting started guide in the cookbook is here -\><https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/>

We'd love to know about the kind of work you are doing on the hub, and I'll follow up in the next few months. 

Best, 

... 

\
\
\

**Email for workshop specific:** 

\

Hi - 

I have added you to the NASA Openscapes GitHub Organization's Workshop Team. Please check your email and accept this invitation from GitHub. Once you have joined the team, you will be able to access the JupyterHub. 

-   Here is the link to the hub: <https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/> 

-   Here is the material for the Workshop NAME\> <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2023-ssc/> 

Have a great workshop - 

 

\
\

6\. In the [Form Response Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Qg8YtUegXs9bepJzvK4UN54bX8BLXTrhxsjb2uV_6k/edit?resourcekey#gid=1824163684), in Column G add the date they were added to the Hub - in part so that we as admins knew if someone had already fulfilled the request. Rows 453+ are the most recent, but it can vary. Check Column A for the date of the form request.

\
\

## Directions for participants

1.  Please go to <https://github.com/nasa-openscapes>

2.  Click the big yellow bar that says "you've been invited" 

3.  Not seeing that bar? 

    1.  Are you logged into [GitHub.com](https://github.com)?

    2.  Have you shared your GitHub username via [this form](https://forms.gle/XRPsKiqaZC4bkYoi8)?

## Notes on process and any issues

Yuvi has started documenting the issues we are running into here -\> <https://hackmd.io/tWfqVai4SDC1CbQ4mhfIbw> 

### SSC-Workshop

3 users with 403 errors - I see they have "pending invitation" but the one email they got they accepted it

Let me uninvite and re-invite

1:37

I just re-invited both

1:38

they will get a 403 until we can clear the pending invite

\

### VITALS at AGU

\

#### **Workshop operations**

\

1.  Some people went to generic <https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/> , not the nbgitpuller link that was available via the Book, so they didn't have the vitals.git folder that was needed. 

2.  Also, maybe have JupyterHub link open in a different window. People lose the book

\

#### Learner questions

\

-   How open source packages interoperate in open communities - "Was that the emit python library or plotting" - it was hvplot. "Is that a nasa package" No it's a python library

### 2023-Cloud-Workshop-AGU

19 participants in person!

\

-   When we started to plan, emphasize hybrid first for helpers and Q&A. 

    -   Repeat the question

-   Google form proliferation - we didn't know about <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfir0YIPhY5AJ6lpO1qOo-Wm1gjl7nXPasPjTKD3OCIhQo82A/viewform>   

-   

-   [AGU_WorkshopNASA-Openscapes_JupyterHubAccess (Responses)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oL-96UDNTtfyETrx_IzTb_Q5m2wZbg-Xm5h8Ba72cJw/edit?resourcekey&pli=1#gid=1064493238) 

\

-   EULA GES DISC trouble

    -   For the EULA to access one of the datasets, go here: https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov

    -   

    -   And follow these instructions: <https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/earthdata-login>

    -   If it's not available in the "Accept New EULAs" list then it is likely in Accepted

Danny really great pace and live coding; calmly troubleshooting and rerunning previous cells when got an error "no earthaccess"

\

**Amy Steiker**  [3:34 PM](https://openscapes.slack.com/archives/C01SRCSQGER/p1702251280897479)

I'm seeing a core.57 file showing up in Danny's tutorials folder in the Hub and just wanted to pass along conversation I recently saw in CryoCloud's slack on these files:

Luis Lopez  \[1:46 PM\]

I think they are core dumps (memory dumps) generated when the kernel "explodes" in the VM

Luis Lopez  \[1:47 PM\]

adding them to .gitignore is super recommended, I've seen a few committed to projects by accident and they are not small.

Wilson Sauthoff  \[1:49 PM\]

[\@Luis López](https://openscapes.slack.com/team/U0231CYHMNH), you must be right because i've been killing my kernel a lot lately. great to tip to add to gitignore. thanks!

Scott Henderson  \[4:53 PM\]

Thanks \@Wilson Sauthoff for pointing this out. I also nticed them showing up on the cryo loud jupyterHub (but never if I'm running Jupyter lab locally) so I opened this issue with 2i2c a while back. If anyone has a reproducible example of when they show up please comment on that issue! <https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/3321>

\

## Troubleshooting

### 403 error

To fix: User needs to accept the GitHub invitation

Double-check pending members:

### Didn't get the email

Go to <https://github.com/nasa-openscapes>, see the big yellow bar that says You're invited.

## User Storage notes

From Yuvi Dec 7: so if you login to openscapes aws account and go to <https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/openscapeshub-prod-homedirs-archive?region=us-west-2&prefix=archives/&showversions=false> now, you should start seeing some username archives. can you confirm you can access that? I think the way you can share that with end users is to use a presigned URL from the web interface (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html>, look under 'using the s3 console'). It will allow you to get a uRL that's valid for a set number of hours that you can send to whoever, and they'll be able to download it if necessary. and this can be done by anyone with aws access, although i don't think 2i2c has capacity to handle this servicing right now. If this looks good to you, i can figure out the deletion code so we can start actually deleting stuff ![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kI77YOxdD-R-Z2SGqfo2t-UVw_ldJPTnEb7vPynKrJY4sorxFKW_jFF-37bc6tGxyLvYx7iABTi7XDoykZNyshKI11cQMykWevkXbu_8Jw7VOrfvxxE1FZW0yarbL8ssNZqTIKxsHKCb5kt9QqIXkuU){alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"}
