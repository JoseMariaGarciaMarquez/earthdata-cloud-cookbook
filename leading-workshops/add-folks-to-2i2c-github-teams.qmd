GitHub will ask you for 2-factor authentication for the first one you add, not after that.

This is what this looks like in their inbox:

6.  Go back to the form and grab their email address. Send one of the following emails to the person.

**Email for workshop specific:** 

Subject: NASA Openscapes Access to 2i2c Hub

Hi \[FIRST NAME\] - 

I have added you to the NASA Openscapes GitHub Organization's Workshop Team. Please check your email and accept this invitation from GitHub. Once you have joined the team, you will be able to access the JupyterHub. 

-   Here is the link to the hub: <https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/> 

-   Here is the material for the Workshop NAME> <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2023-ssc/> 

Have a great workshop - 

...

**Email for General requests:** 

Subject: NASA Openscapes Access to 2i2c Hub

Hi \[FIRST NAME\] - 

I have added you to the NASA Openscapes 2i2c Jupyter Hub. Here is the link to the hub: <https://openscapes.2i2c.cloud/> 

There is a getting started guide in the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook here: <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/>

We'd love to know about the kind of work you are doing on the hub, and I'll follow up in the next few months. 

Best, 

... 

 

7.  In the [Form Response Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Qg8YtUegXs9bepJzvK4UN54bX8BLXTrhxsjb2uV_6k/edit?resourcekey#gid=1824163684), in Column G add the date they were added to the Hub - in part so that we as admins knew if someone had already fulfilled the request. Rows 453+ are the most recent, but it can vary. Check Column A for the date of the form request.

## Directions for participants

1.  Please go to <https://github.com/nasa-openscapes>

2.  Click the big yellow bar that says "you've been invited" 

3.  Not seeing that bar? 

    1.  Are you logged into [GitHub.com](https://github.com)?

    2.  Have you shared your GitHub username via [this form](https://forms.gle/XRPsKiqaZC4bkYoi8)?

## Troubleshooting

### Users get 403 error

This is a common issue. User must find email notification from GitHub and accept invitation. If they had clicked in email to accept but did not complete accepting in GitHub, edit their invitation in GitHub to uninvite and reinvite. They should get new email to accept.
