title: Workshops & Hackathons
---

We develop tutorials for teaching events that each have their own e-book. The following is a list of past workshops or hackathons we have hosted with links to their respective e-books. Tutorials are developed to teach open science and Cloud workflows for specific audiences. They are a snapshot in time as workflows with NASA Earthdata Cloud emerge and evolve. We will be updating [How-To Guides](../how-tos/index.qmd) as more stable ("source") instruction as we develop and learn from the teachings below.

## 2023 GEDI / ICESat-2 Workshop 

[**https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2023-ssc/**](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2023-ssc/){.uri}

The goal of this workshop, as part of the [2023 Space and Sustainability Colloquium](https://espacioysostenibilidad.com/en/#), is to demonstrate how to find, access, and work with GEDI and ICESat-2 data from the Earthdata Cloud. Participants will learn how to search for and download data from NASAâ€™s Earthdata Search Client, a graphical user interface (GUI) for search, discovery, and download application for also EOSDIS data assets. Participants will learn how to perform in-cloud data search, access, and processing routines where no data download is required, and data analysis can take place next to the data in the cloud.

## 2022 ECOSTRESS Cloud Workshop

[**https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2022-ECOSTRESS-Cloud-Workshop/**](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2022-ECOSTRESS-Cloud-Workshop/){.uri}

The goal of the workshop is expose ECOSTRESS data users to ECOSTRESS version 2 (v2) data products in the cloud. Learning objectives focus on how to find and access ECOSTRESS v2 data from Earthdata Cloud either by downloading or accessing the data on the cloud. The LP DAAC is the NASA archive for ECOSTRESS data products. ECOSTRESS v2 data products will hosted in the NASA Earthdata Cloud, hosted in AWS.

## 2022 SWOT Ocean Cloud Workshop

[**https://podaac.github.io/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop/**](https://podaac.github.io/2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop/){.uri}

The goal of the workshop is to get ready for Surface Water and Ocean Topography ([SWOT](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/)) and enable the (oceanography) science team to be ready for processing and handling the large volumes of SWOT SSH data in the cloud. Learning objectives focus on how to access the [simulated SWOT L2 SSH data](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/announcements/2022-01-31-Release-simulated-SWOT-SSH-version1-datasets) from Earthdata Cloud either by downloading or accessing the data on the cloud. PO.DAAC is the NASA archive for the SWOT mission, and once launched will be making data available via the NASA Earthdata Cloud, hosted in AWS.

## 2021 Cloud AGU Workshop

[**https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Workshop-AGU**](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Workshop-AGU){.uri}

The **2021 Cloud Workshop at AGU: Enabling Analysis in the Cloud Using NASA Earth Science Data** is a virtual half-day collaborative open science learning experience aimed at exploring, learning, and promoting effective cloud-based science and applications workflows using NASA Earthdata Cloud data, tools, and services (among others), in support of Earth science data processing and analysis in the era of big data.

## 2021 Cloud Hackathon

[**https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon**](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon){.uri}

The **Cloud Hackathon: Transitioning Earthdata Workflows to the Cloud** is a virtual 5-day (4 hours per day) collaborative open science learning experience aimed at exploring, creating, and promoting effective cloud-based science and applications workflows using NASA Earthdata Cloud data, tools, and services (among others), in support of Earth science data processing and analysis in the era of big data. Its goals are to:

1.  **Introduce** Earth science data users to NASA Earthdata cloud-based data products, tools and services in order to increase awareness and support transition to cloud-based science and applications workflows.

2.  **Enable** science and applications workflows in the cloud that leverage NASA Earth Observations and capabilities (services) from within the NASA Earthdata Cloud, hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, thus increasing NASA Earthdata data utility and meaningfulness for science and applications use cases.

3.  **Foster community engagement** utilizing Earthdata cloud tools and services in support of open science and open data.
