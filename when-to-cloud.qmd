## When To Cloud

- opening sentence(s) with link to homepage/Welcome on cloud

### Questions to Ask Yourself
- what does it mean to be in the cloud?
        - accessing services via internet? no
        - logging into an AWS/Azure/etc account (awareness)? yes    
- include workflow type figures and discuss
    - link to any relevant tutorials that demo these workflows
    - how can you "cloud"?
    - what's already available (services that assist)
- listing questions from Andy's slides
    - a bit of discussion + examples for each question
    - concrete examples accomapnying each question
    - "I have a TB of storage on my laptop...." storage scenarios
    - (see this from Ryan Abernathy?)
    - include a question on actions that are already services (subsetting, etc.)


### Challenges
- feedback from Champions/workshop participants
- (see Alexis ESIp poster)
- (this could be its own section on website?)

### Considerations
- separation from physical signs of compute power (using resources/energy)
- physical location of "the cloud"
- testing/playing locally before migrating workflow to the cloud
- working remotely (not WFH, but computer is remote)
- environmental impacts
