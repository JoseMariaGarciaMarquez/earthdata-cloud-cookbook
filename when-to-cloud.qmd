### Questions to Ask Yourself
- what does it mean to be in the cloud?
        - accessing services via internet? no
        - logging into an AWS/Azure/etc account (awareness)? yes    
- include workflow type figures and discuss
    - link to any relevant tutorials that demo these workflows
    - how can you "cloud"?
    - what's already available (services that assist)
- listing questions from Andy's slides
    - a bit of discussion + examples for each question
    - concrete examples accomapnying each question
    - "I have a TB of storage on my laptop...." storage scenarios
    - (see this from Ryan Abernathy: https://medium.com/pangeo/closed-platforms-vs-open-architectures-for-cloud-native-earth-system-analytics-1ad88708ebb6)
    - include a question on actions that are already services (subsetting, etc.)


### Challenges
It is important to be aware of the drawbacks and challenges associated with working in the cloud. Common feedback from early cloud adopters are summarized here:
    - feedback from Champions/workshop participants
    - (see Alexis ESIp poster)
    - (this could be its own section on website?)

### Considerations
We are now accustomed to living in a highly digital world, separated from physical reminders of the services we use. No longer do we access documents from a row of filing cabinets, we now store them in cloud-based archives (e.g. Google Docs). We run code on high-performance computing clusters, removed from the whirring and warmth generated by servers that live away from our desks. The following are considerations for using cloud-based resources:
    - separation from physical signs of compute power (using resources/energy)
    - physical location of "the cloud", whose land is it on?
    - testing/playing locally before migrating workflow to the cloud
    - working remotely (not WFH, but computer is remote)
    - environmental impacts
